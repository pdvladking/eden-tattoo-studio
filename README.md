# Eden Tattoo Studio ðŸ–¤

A dark-themed, narrative-driven tattoo studio site built with Next.js and Tailwind. No toggles, no distractionsâ€”just locked aesthetic and scroll rhythm. Designed for presence, not permission.

Eden isnâ€™t just a studioâ€”itâ€™s a story. This build explores identity, permanence, and rebellion through UI/UX. Every section is intentional. Every border is a statement.
